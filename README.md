## Introduction:
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Global Superstore dataset, a rich data source from a multinational online retailer based in New York with customers across 147 countries. 

The company offers over 10,000 products across three major categories: Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technology.
As a Data Analyst, I was contracted to extract meaningful insights from this dataset to support management decision-making aimed at boosting business performance and profitability.

## Tools & Techniques Used:
•	Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

•	Data Modeling to structure relationships for efficient analysis

•	DAX and calculated fields to generate KPIs and metrics

•	Power BI Visualizations to present insights in an intuitive, interactive dashboard

•	Exploratory Data Analysis for identifying trends, patterns, and performance gaps

## Analysis:
### What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?
Based on the analysis of Global Superstore’s 2014 data, the three countries that generated the highest total profit (pounds) were:
1.	United States – £94,000
2.	India – £49,000
3.	China – £47,000

The United States significantly outperformed all other countries, accounting for nearly twice the profit of the next most profitable country, India. This indicates strong market presence and performance in North America, while India and China also represent key growth regions in Asia.

### For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit (Pounds). Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product? 
 - United States – Total Profit:£ 94,000
 
The most profitable product in the U.S. was the Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier, generating approximately £15,680 in profit. 

This was followed by the Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3310 Copier with £3,624.

The GBC DocuBind TL300 Electric Binding System, which brought in £1,911.

- India – Total Profit: £49,000
 
In India, the Sauder Classic Bookcase (Traditional) led with a profit of £2,420.

The Cisco Smart Phone with Caller ID at £1,609.

The Hamilton Beach Refrigerator (Red) at £1,440.

- China – Total Profit: £47,000
  
China's top products included the Sauder Classic Bookcase (Metal) with £1,463.

The Bush Classic Bookcase (Mobile) at £1,221.

The HP Color Copy Machine with a profit of £1,196.

### Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States 

The three subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States in 2014 were:

- Copiers – 165
- Machines – 132
- Tables – 70

These categories likely incur higher shipping fees due to their size, weight, or special handling requirements, which could impact pricing and logistics decisions.

### Nigeria’s Profitability Compared to Other African Countries

In 2014, Nigeria recorded a total loss of -£23,285, making it one of the least profitable countries in Africa for Global Superstore. 

This contrasts sharply with the performance of other African countries, many of which showed modest profits or lower losses.

### Factors Contributing to Nigeria’s Poor Performance

Two key factors appear to be driving Nigeria’s negative profitability:

•	High Average Shipping Cost: At 1,518, shipping to Nigeria is significantly more expensive than in many other countries.

•	Excessive Average Discount: An average discount of 0.70 (70%) heavily reduces profit margins and likely contributes to consistent losses.

These findings suggest that logistics inefficiencies and aggressive discounting strategies are undermining profitability in the Nigerian market. Addressing these issues could help improve performance in the region.

### Least Profitable Subcategory in Southeast Asia

In Southeast Asia, the Tables subcategory was the least profitable, recording a significant loss of -£18,618.

This indicates weak demand or high cost-to-serve for this product type across the region.

### Country Recommendation for Product Withdrawal

Within Southeast Asia, Indonesia showed the most substantial loss from table sales, with a total loss of -£10,680.

Based on this, it is recommended that Global Superstore discontinue offering tables in Indonesia to mitigate further losses and reallocate resources to more profitable subcategories.

### Least Profitable U.S. City (by Average Profit)

 After excluding cities with fewer than 10 orders, 
 
 Lancaster was identified as the least profitable city in the United States, with an average profit of -£157.


 ### Highest Average Profit Subcategory in Australia
 
 the Appliances subcategory recorded the highest average profit in Australia, with an average of £139 per order.
 
 This indicates strong product performance and customer demand, making it a key area for strategic investment and inventory expansion in the region.

### Most Valuable Customers 

Based on the total sales value, the following individuals are identified as Global Superstore's top 10 most valuable customers:

-	Tom Ashbrook – £40,000
-	Tamara Chand – £37,000
-	Hunter Lopez – £30,000
-	Raymond Buch – £30,000
-	Susan Pistek – £29,000
-	Bill Eplett – £28,000
-	Harry Marie – £28,000
-	Sanjit Chand – £27,000
-	Adrian Barton – £25,000
-	Mike Gockenbach – £23,000

These customers contribute significantly to overall revenue and should be prioritized for customer retention strategies, such as loyalty programs, targeted marketing, or premium service offerings. 

Analyzing their product preferences and order patterns can also inform stock planning and personalized upselling opportunities.

### Recommendations
- High-performing markets like the U.S., India, and China should be prioritized through increased inventory, targeted promotions, and stronger marketing to drive continued growth.
- Product lines with consistent losses, such as Tables in Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia, should be discontinued or reimagined in favor of alternatives better suited to regional demand.
- In underperforming regions like Nigeria, high losses driven by shipping costs and heavy discounting call for a review of logistics, pricing, and fulfillment strategies.
- Australia’s strong profit margins in the Appliances category present an opportunity to scale up inventory and marketing efforts in that segment.
- Shipping costs remain high for items like Copiers, Machines, and Tables in the U.S. Warehousing closer to key markets or adjusting pricing to absorb shipping costs could help improve margins.
- Top customers who generate significant revenue should be retained through loyalty programs, exclusive deals, or personalized offers.
- Cities like Lancaster, which show low profitability, need operational audits to address possible inefficiencies, delivery challenges, or poor product fit.
- Consistently top-selling products, such as Canon Copiers and Sauder Bookcases, should be featured prominently in bundles and promotional campaigns to drive broader sales.
